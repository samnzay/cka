## Task
Create a new service account with the name ```pvviewer```. Grant this Service account access to `list` all PersistentVolumes in the cluster by creating an appropriate cluster role called `pvviewer-role` and ClusterRoleBinding called `pvviewer-role-binding`.
Next, create a pod called `pvviewer` with the `image: redis` and `serviceAccount: pvviewer` in the default namespace.

## Solution
Pods authenticate to the API Server using ServiceAccounts. If the serviceAccount name is not specified, the default service account for the namespace is used during a pod creation.

Reference: https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-service-account/

- Now, create a service account pvviewer:
```shell
kubectl create serviceaccount pvviewer
```

- To create a clusterrole:
```shell
kubectl create clusterrole pvviewer-role --resource=persistentvolumes --verb=list
```

- To create a clusterrolebinding:
```shell
kubectl create clusterrolebinding pvviewer-role-binding --clusterrole=pvviewer-role --serviceaccount=default:pvviewer
```

- Solution manifest file to create a new pod called pvviewer as follows:

```shell
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  labels:
    run: pvviewer
  name: pvviewer
spec:
  containers:
  - image: redis
    name: pvviewer
  # Add service account name
  serviceAccountName: pvviewer
```
