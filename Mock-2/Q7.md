Create a nginx pod called ```nginx-resolver``` using image ```nginx```, expose it internally with a service called ```nginx-resolver-service```. Test that you are able to look up the service and pod names from within the cluster. Use the `image: busybox:1.28` for dns lookup. Record results in `/root/CKA/nginx.svc` and `/root/CKA/nginx.pod`


Pod: nginx-resolver created

Service DNS Resolution recorded correctly

Pod DNS resolution recorded correctly

## Solution
Use the command kubectl run and create a nginx pod and busybox pod. Resolve it, nginx service and its pod name from busybox pod.

- To create a pod nginx-resolver and expose it internally:
```shell
kubectl run nginx-resolver --image=nginx
kubectl expose pod nginx-resolver --name=nginx-resolver-service --port=80 --target-port=80 --type=ClusterIP
```

- To create a pod test-nslookup. Test that you are able to look up the service and pod names from within the cluster:
```shell
kubectl run test-nslookup --image=busybox:1.28 --rm -it --restart=Never -- nslookup nginx-resolver-service
kubectl run test-nslookup --image=busybox:1.28 --rm -it --restart=Never -- nslookup nginx-resolver-service > /root/CKA/nginx.svc
```

Get the IP of the nginx-resolver pod and replace the dots(.) with hyphon(-) which will be used below.
```shell
kubectl get pod nginx-resolver -o wide
kubectl run test-nslookup --image=busybox:1.28 --rm -it --restart=Never -- nslookup < P-O-D-I >
```
