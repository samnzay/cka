A pod definition file is created at `/root/CKA/use-pv.yaml`. Make use of this manifest file and mount the persistent volume called `pv-1`. Ensure the pod is running and the PV is bound.

mountPath: /data

persistentVolumeClaim Name: my-pvc

## Solution
Add a persistentVolumeClaim definition to pod definition file.

Solution manifest file to create a pvc my-pvc as follows:
```yaml
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: my-pvc
spec:
  accessModes:
  - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
       storage: 10Mi
```

And then, update the pod definition file as follows:
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  creationTimestamp: null
  labels:
    run: use-pv
  name: use-pv
spec:
  containers:
  - image: nginx
    name: use-pv
    volumeMounts:
    - mountPath: "/data"
      name: mypd
  volumes:
    - name: mypd
      persistentVolumeClaim:
        claimName: my-pvc
```
