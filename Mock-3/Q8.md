## Task
A kubeconfig file called super.kubeconfig has been created under /root/CKA. There is something wrong with the configuration. Troubleshoot and fix it.

## Solution
- Verify host and port for kube-apiserver are correct.

Change the `9999` port to `6443` and run the below command to verify:
```shell
kubectl cluster-info --kubeconfig=/root/CKA/super.kubeconfig
```
