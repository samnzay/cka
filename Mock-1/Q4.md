Create a new deployment called `nginx-deploy`, with image `nginx:1.16` and 1 replica.
Next, upgrade the deployment to version 1.17 using rolling update and add the annotation message
Updated nginx image to 1.17.

## Solution
Deployment Creation and Update with Annotation
Follow these steps to create a deployment, update its image, and record the change using annotations.

### Step 1: Create the Deployment
Use the kubectl create command to create a deployment named nginx-deploy with the nginx:1.16 image.
```shell
kubectl create deployment nginx-deploy --image=nginx:1.16
```

### Step 2: Update the Deployment Image
Update the nginx-deploy deployment to use the nginx:1.17 image.
```shell
kubectl set image deployment/nginx-deploy nginx=nginx:1.17
```
### Step 3: Annotate the Deployment to Record the Change
Manually annotate the deployment to log the change, replacing the functionality of the deprecated --record option.
```shell
kubectl annotate deployment nginx-deploy kubernetes.io/change-cause="Updated nginx image to 1.17"
```
This annotation acts as a record of the image update.
