Task
Taint the worker node node01 to be Unschedulable. Once done, create a pod called dev-redis, image redis:alpine, to ensure workloads are not scheduled to this worker node. Finally, create a new pod called prod-redis and image: redis:alpine with toleration to be scheduled on node01.

key: env_type, value: production, operator: Equal and effect: NoSchedule

## Solution
- To add taints on the node01 worker node:
```shell
kubectl taint node node01 env_type=production:NoSchedule
```

- Now, deploy dev-redis pod and to ensure that workloads are not scheduled to this node01 worker node.
```shell
kubectl run dev-redis --image=redis:alpine
```

- To view the node name of recently deployed pod:
```shell
kubectl get pods -o wide
```

- Solution manifest file to deploy new pod called `prod-redis` with toleration to be scheduled on `node01` worker node.

```yaml
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: prod-redis
spec:
  containers:
  - name: prod-redis
    image: redis:alpine
  tolerations:
  - effect: NoSchedule
    key: env_type
    operator: Equal
    value: production    
``` 

To view only prod-redis pod with less details:
```shell
kubectl get pods -o wide | grep prod-redis
```
