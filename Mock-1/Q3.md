A kubeconfig file called admin.kubeconfig has been created in /root/CKA. There is something wrong with the configuration. Troubleshoot and fix it.

## Solution
Make sure the port for the kube-apiserver is correct. So for this change port from 4380 to 6443.

Run the below command to know the cluster information:
```shell
kubectl cluster-info --kubeconfig /root/CKA/admin.kubeconfig
```
